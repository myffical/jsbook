===================================

### [Overview](overview.html)

What is JavaScript? Brief history. Common use-cases. Runtime environments. ECMAScript standards. Overview of language features. Running JavaScript in the browser and at the command line. Debugging JavaScript in the browser. The console and REPL.

### [Values and Variables](values-and-variables.html)

Values and literals. Primitive types. Numbers. Integer and floating point as a single type. Special floating point numbers. Rounding errors. The `Math` library. Strings. Immutability of strings. `+` and `[]` operators. `toString`. Common string utilities. Booleans. Ternary operator. Truth-y and False-y values. `null` and `undefined`. Regular expressions. Dynamic typing. Weak typing. The `typeof` operator. The `===` and `!==` operators. Control statements.

### [Arrays and Objects](arrays-and-objects.html)

Arrays. Array insertion and deletion. Array length. Sparse arrays. Multidimensional arrays. Almost everything is an object. Objects as unordered maps. Object creation, modification and lookup syntax. Nested objects. Object methods. The `delete` keyword. The `for... in` statement, and the `hasOwnProperty` method. The global `window` object. Object references. Aliasing. Pass-by-reference-copy semantics.

### [Functions](functions.html)

Function declaration and invocation syntax. Anonymous functions. Functions as data. The `arguments` object. Variadic functions. Optional parameters. Named parameters. Function overloading. Duck typing.

### [HTML and CSS](html-and-css.html) and [The Document Object Model](dom.html)

Tags. Document structure. Elements. Text, forms, images, blocks and frames. Selectors. Cascading and inheritence. Text and color tyles. The box model. Layout. The DOM as an document API. Browser information. The `setTimer` and `setTimeout`. Element lookup. Tree traversal. Attribute getting and setting. Creating and deleting nodes. Events.

### [jQuery](jquery.html)

Overview of jQuery. Cross-browser compatibility. The `$` function object. Element selectors. Tree traversal. Node creation, insertion, modification and deletion. Getting and setting attributes, styles and class. Wrapping and unwrapping DOM raw objects. The chaining pattern.

### [More jQuery](more-jquery.html)

Event handling. `bind` and `unbind`. Keyboard and mouse events. Event delegation and bubbling. Animation.

### AJAX with jQuery

AJAX. Asynchronous communication. Callback functions. The `get` and `post` formats. Same-origin policy. Cross-origin requests with JSONP. AJAX polling.

### Context

Object method invocation as method passing. The `this` variable as an implicit parameter variable. Problems with methods in event handlers and callbacks. Usage of `call` and `apply`. Binding context. The `new` keyword.

### Closures

Lexical scope. Inner functions. Closure scope. Examining closure scope in the debugger. Functors. Simulation of private object properties. Simulation of namespaces.

### Higher-order Functions

Functional programming. Side effects. Referential transparancy. Iteration over collections without loops. Implementation of map, reduce, find, filter.

### More Higher-Order Functions

Implementation of curry, memoize, and debounce.

### Security

Same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting attacks (reflected and persisted). Cookie theft and forgery. Whitelisting and blacklisting.

### Node.js

Server-side scripting. Threaded vs event-based server models. Working with callbacks. The Express web framework.

### HTML 5 APIs

HTML 5 APIs.

### d3.js

Data visualization. Drawing graphics using SVG. Selections with `select` and `selectAll`. Adding and deleting elements with `enter` and `exit`. Binding data with `data`. Animation with `transition`.

### The Future of JavaScript

Current trends in JavaScript. JIT engines. New EMCAScript features. The HTML5 roadmap. Alternative MVC frameworks: AngularJS, Ember.js, Knockout. CoffeeScript. Trends towards fat clients and API-based services.
